# Contributing

We can use help in a bunch of areas and any help is appreciated. Our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/romejs/rome/issues) serve as a place for any discussion, wheter it's bug reports, questions, project direction etc. As the project grows this policy may change.

Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9WxHa5d) is open for help and more adhoc discussion. All activity on the Discord is still moderated and will be strictly enforced under the project's [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Getting started with developing Rome is as easy as three commands. You will need Node v12 or above.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/romejs/rome
$ cd rome
$ scripts/dev-rome --help
```

No dependency installation step is required as we check in our [`node_modules`](node_modules) folder that contains only a copy of TypeScript and some definitions.
